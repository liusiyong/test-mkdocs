## What is FlowMate

FlowMate helps you to connect any app with an API with any other, and manipulate its data with little or no code. FlowMate allows you to:

**1. Sync data between 200+ apps**  
Move and transform data between different apps and databases without getting caught up in API docs and troubleshooting CORS errors.
 
**2. Design powerful workflows**  
Go beyond ETL: start with simple no-code flows and add javascript functions, conditional logic, or custom http requests in a snap.  

**3. Create custom integrations**  
Design bespoke nodes for a proprietary CRM, endpoints for your product, or any other software, and empower your marketing and ops teams to create their own workflows.
